This is a test to investigate the fact that when I navigate back to a previous page using a link generated from S.referer , 
the RequestVars are still holding the values they had when the user was last on that page.

Is that intended behaviour? I am carrying around the expectation that RequestVars were always initially unset for a new request
unless explicitly set using a pattern like: SHtml.link("/nextpage", () => { someRequestVar("fred") }, Text("Next Page") )
  
  
For example, consider navigation between three pages Test, Test2, Test3.

Test 
 |
 | Set RequestVar using SHtml.link("/page2", () => { name("fred") }, Text("Page2")) *
 V
Test 2
 |
 | No RequestVar set
 V
Test 3
 |
 | Back to Test 2 via S.referer
 V
Test 2 - RequestVar has same value as set at (*)
